          "Unlike most etymologies, we actually know the exact date that the
          phrase in question was first written down for mass public consumption
          as well as the exact date it was first spoken out loud. In regards to
          the former, the first time the phrase appeared in print was 1979 in an
          LA Times article where it said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶and the Couch Potatoes who will be
          lying on couches watching television as they are towed toward the
          parade route.‚Äù In regards to the latter, according to the man who
          coined the phrase, he first uttered it during a phone call on July 15,
          1976.
        </p>

        <p style="width: 60%;">
          More specifically, the man who breathed the phrase into existence is
          <i>Tom Lacino</i>. He stated he coined the phrase during ‚Äúa phone call
          to a friend. His girlfriend answered, and it was just an off-the-top
          sort of thing when I said, ‚ÄòHey, is the couch potato there?‚Äô She
          looked over and there he was on the couch, and she started cracking
          up.
        </p>

        <p style="width: 60%;">
          Although <i>Lacino</i> claims that there was no real thought behind
          the phrase, other than that he thought it was a pretty funny way to
          describe his friend, linguists have noted that the phrase is actually
          a rather clever play on words. To explain, during the 1970s a popular
          term for the television was, ‚Äúthe boob tube‚Äù which was coined by
          people who believed watching television was a pursuit only enjoyed by
          the foolish. Since the edible part of a potato plant is known as a
          ‚Äútuber‚Äù, it is commonly believed that the phrase ‚Äúcouch potato‚Äù was
          intended as a clever combination of these two concepts ..."

          "While <i>Lacino</i> was perhaps not initially aware of the playful
          subtleties behind his utterance, his friend
          <i>Robert Armstrong</i> certainly was and after hearing the phrase
          repeated back to him by Tom, <i>Armstrong</i> asked Lacino for
          permission to turn it into a cartoon.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 60%;">
          At the time this was taking place, both <i>Lacino</i>Lacino and
          Armstrong were members of a group calling themselves the ‚ÄúBoob Tubers‚Äù
          which was an orginization created in 1973 in humourous response to a
          growing health-craze movement in California at the time.In contrast to
          this movement, the main goal of the Boob Tubers was basically to sit
          in front of a television and eat junk food ..."
        </p>
        <p style="width: 60%;">
          <i>Armstrong</i>,who was a cartoonist by trade, is the one credited
          with really pushing the phrase into mainstream lexicon when in 1979
          under the new name of ‚ÄúThe Couch Potatoes‚Äù, he, <i>Tom</i> and several
          others sailed a float in the Doo Dah Parade (an event meant to parody
          the more famous Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena). The float,
          which literally consisted of nothing more than a few couches pointed
          at a couple of working TVs on which the group sat for the duration of
          the parade, was a huge hit and its subsequent media coverage resulted
          in the first known publicly written use of the term in the
          aforementioned 1979 LA Times article. <i>Armstrong</i>, inspired by
          the success, created a bunch of merchandise around the concept of a
          couch potato, even going so far as to publish a newsletter aptly
          called ‚ÄúThe Tuber‚Äôs Voice: The Couch Potato‚Äôs Newsletter‚Äú. Though
          <i>Armstrong</i> had the foresight to trademark the phrase in 1979, it
          was simply too popular. Despite his best efforts, the sheer ubiquity
          of the phrase in media and print meant that he could no longer claim
          exclusivity to it."
